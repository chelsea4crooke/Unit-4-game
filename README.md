When the player clicks a crystal it will add a specific number of points to the players total score. The game hides the crystal point value until it is clicked, when one is clicked the players total score updates. The player wins the game by matching their total score with the random number from the start of the game. If the player over shoots this random number the game is lost, if the player matches this number the game is won. The game restarts whenever the player wins or looses.
